# Gee(WSGI)

This is an experimental Python WSGI. I have some ideas here I'd like to explore around logging to metrics collection systems, making it easier to serve static JS framework frontends with Python backends, and maybe even making SSL stuff easier. Who knows? But this is *NOT YET INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION*. If you are looking for a WSGI, please use [uwsgi](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/).
